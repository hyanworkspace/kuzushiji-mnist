```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## Kuzushiji （崩し字）
Yesterday when I was watching Kaggle's No Free Hunch, I found an article about Japanese cursives, originally an article in the NIPS 2018 workshop.
    
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
